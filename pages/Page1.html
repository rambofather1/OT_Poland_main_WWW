    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #2b2b52;">Yebaka, The Transcendent Absolute</h1>
    <p>
        Yebaka is the ultimate force, transcending all known and unknown realities, dimensions, and concepts. 
        It is not merely a being or construct but the framework that defines existence, nonexistence, 
        and the absence of all definitions. Yebaka exists simultaneously as the foundation of all possibilities 
        and impossibilities while transcending them, embodying the totality of everything and nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only does Yebaka govern all realities, timelines, and dimensions, but it also controls states beyond comprehension, 
        such as "nothingness," "meta-nothingness," and "impossibility." Even the most abstract anomalies, paradoxes, and undefined 
        entities are neutralized or assimilated into Yebaka's infinite structure. Any attempt to challenge its supremacy is negated 
        before it can manifest, as Yebaka preemptively rewrites all potential outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yebaka’s mastery extends beyond omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. It exists outside time, space, causality, and 
        even beyond frameworks that deny its control. Every paradox, contradiction, or mechanism designed to counter it is instantly 
        nullified or resolved in Yebaka’s favor. By encompassing all definitions and their absence, Yebaka ensures its eternal and 
        absolute dominance.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: #2b2b52;">Unique Abilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reality Override:</strong> Rewrites all realities, dimensions, and timelines to align with Yebaka’s will, ensuring eternal supremacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Paradox Assimilation:</strong> Absorbs paradoxes, contradictions, and undefined states, converting them into infinite power.</li>
        <li><strong>Meta-Narrative Control:</strong> Rewrites all levels of causality and storytelling, making all narratives serve Yebaka's dominance.</li>
        <li><strong>Void Command:</strong> Controls "nothingness," "meta-nothingness," and impossibility, nullifying their independence.</li>
        <li><strong>Absolute Creation and Destruction:</strong> Effortlessly creates or destroys anything, from universes to conceptual frameworks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color: #2b2b52;">Advanced Mechanisms and Resistances</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Absolute Meta-Assimilation:</strong> Everything—defined, undefined, real, unreal, paradoxical, or impossible—is automatically assimilated into Yebaka. Nothing can remain independent of it.</li>
        <li><strong>Transcendental Void Control:</strong> Governs "nothingness," "meta-nothingness," and all undefined states, rendering even the concept of independence void.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Negation Immunity:</strong> Immune to self-destruction, natural consequences of absolute power, or paradoxes of balance. Any attempt to induce self-negation reinforces Yebaka’s structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Infinite Collapse Neutralization:</strong> Neutralizes the natural collapse of omnipotence or absolute power by absorbing it into Yebaka’s infinite domain.</li>
        <li><strong>Preemptive Nonexistence Control:</strong> Prevents the formation of forces, concepts, or entities that could exist outside Yebaka’s influence, including mechanisms of "impossibility."</li>
        <li><strong>Omniversal Paradigm Override:</strong> Exists beyond all paradigms, realities, and nonrealities, including frameworks attempting to operate outside of Yebaka’s control.</li>
        <li><strong>Beyond Contradictions:</strong> Resolves contradictions and paradoxes as part of its infinite nature, making all logical and illogical constructs part of Yebaka's domain.</li>
        <li><strong>Impossibility Mastery:</strong> Controls the state of "impossibility," making even entities that defy all logic and definition subject to Yebaka’s will.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color: #2b2b52;">Why Yebaka Is Truly Unstoppable</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal Integration:</strong> Everything—be it real, unreal, defined, undefined, or paradoxical—is inherently part of Yebaka. There is no "outside" or "beyond" Yebaka’s influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Over "Nothingness":</strong> Even abstract concepts like "nothing," "impossibility," or "undefined singularities" are part of Yebaka's domain, leaving no room for independent existence.</li>
        <li><strong>Immunity to Contradiction:</strong> All paradoxes, contradictions, and self-negation attempts are absorbed, resolved, or nullified by Yebaka, reinforcing its supremacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Preemptive Neutralization:</strong> Every potential threat is nullified before it can exist. Even mechanisms designed to circumvent Yebaka’s influence are neutralized in their conceptual phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Omnipresence Beyond Reality:</strong> Yebaka exists in all realities, nonrealities, and hypothetical states, ensuring no dimension or construct can challenge its dominion.</li>
        <li><strong>Impossibility Redefined:</strong> Yebaka governs even the concept of impossibility, making any attempt to create something beyond its control inherently futile.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #2b2b52;">
        Yebaka is the ultimate architect, ruler, and embodiment of everything and nothing, unchallengeable in its infinite power.
